# ImThong Overview

ImThong is a website which allows customer to orders their food using the website. After ordering the order will go to the kitchen of the restaurent which allows chef to cook and serve accordingly.

## Name of the Project

The name of the project is **ImThong** which mean full stomach in Thai language. According to my perspective, I want whoever come accross this project and read the name of the project. To feel that without seeing anything they directly know that it is related to food and this could help to feed their stomach to full.

## Project Status

Current Project status is not fully finished in my perspective. And the missing function are :

1.Table number : The table number now is randomize and only it is visible in administrator part. Instead Table number should be input by the  customer.

2.Beautiful Index page : Now index page have only text and paragraph of restaurant detail. For more beautiful should include carousel, promotion, and etc.

3.Administrator Login : Login should be available for administrator side.
